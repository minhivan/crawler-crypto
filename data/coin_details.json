'이더리움 블록체인 위에서 동작하는 탈중앙화 거래소(Decentralized exchange)를 위한 오픈 프로토콜'을 지향합니다. \r\n\r\n제로엑스 팀은 가까운 미래에 수천개의 이더리움 기반 토큰(ERC 20)이 사용될 것이고, 이 토큰들을 신뢰할 수 있는 효율적인 방법으로 상호 교환하고자 하는 수요가 발생할 것으로 기대합니다. \r\n\r\n이를 위해 제로엑스는 스마트 컨트랙트를 활용한 오픈 프로토콜을 통해 탈중앙화 거래소를 누구나 운영할 수 있도록 하고자 하며,\r\n\r\n주문이 체결될 때에만 거래를 블록체인에 기록함으로써 기존 탈중앙화 거래소의 느린 속도와 비효율을 개선하고자 합니다.","ar":"","th":"","id":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://0x.org/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://0xtracker.com/","https://etherscan.io/token/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498","https://blockchair.com/ethereum/erc-20/token/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498","https://snowtrace.io/token/0x596fa47043f99a4e0f122243b841e55375cde0d2","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/FduK2mE","",""],"announcement_url":["https://blog.0xproject.com/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"0xproject","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"official_0x","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/0xProject/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo","https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs","https://github.com/0xProject/0x-launch-kit","https://github.com/0xProject/0x-starter-project"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/863/thumb/0x.png?1547034672","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/863/small/0x.png?1547034672","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/863/large/0x.png?1547034672"},"country_origin":"US","genesis_date":"2017-08-11","contract_address":"0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":72.73,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":27.27,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2017-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2017-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"The

These tokens are called Xcerts and are created through a custom minting process. Xcerts represent standard non-fungible tokens, which also hold information about a real-world digital asset. With 0xcert protocol, we can validate a proof of existence, authenticity, and ownership of these digital assets without third-party involvement.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also uses fungible tokens known as ZXC as utility tokens in the system and comply with the ERC20 standard on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain. The tokens are used to support decentralized applications that are built on top of the protocol. The role of the token is to be a mechanism used as an incentive and to support the entire ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe flexible nature of the 0xcert protocol infrastructure ensures that interoperability is achieved among decentralized applications. The protocol is flexible enough to support a variety of business models.The availability of the protocol's pluggable framework allows for the reduction of the time used during the building of decentralized applications.The protocol contains a registry of issuers that have been verified on the network, which allows for the authentication of issuers as well as knowing their validity. A common registry reduces the time taken for verification and reduces business risk.","de":"0xcert is an open source, a permission-less protocol for certified non-fungible tokens on the blockchain.
